    1. this is a global variable which consists of an array which is undefined for the purpose of storing objects that the user inputs  

    1. handleSubmit: This function will receive the form data if form validation is successful (Is this React?)
    2. the parentheses (round brackets) after "handleSubmit" reflect empty parameters that will fill when arguments are input
    3. the curly bracket begins the instructions for the function {
    4. "const" is the declaration, "item" is the variable. const represents a "general rule" that does not change while item represents list items the user will input.
    5. "document" object represents the web page
    6. using dot notation we access the objects property "getElementById('todo-item')" which is found in our HTML
    7. the ".value".... is needed to show the input in the submitted line item, otherwise "[object HTMLInputElement]" is shown. So the .value gives us the HTMLInputElement. (Web APIs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement)
    8. we separate statements with semi-colons (;)
    9. This line prevents the user from submitting item if todo-item have no input in the feild
    10. the "if" statement executes a statement if a specified condition is "truthy" or if a condition is "falsy". In this case "If the item equals "", or if the item equals "undefined" a message via the console.log will appear.
    11. "return false" executes halting of the function because the parameters were not met
